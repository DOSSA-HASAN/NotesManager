## Features

- **Add Notes:** Users can add notes by entering text into a text box and clicking the "Add Note" button.
- **Display Notes:** Notes are displayed immediately upon addition and are persisted across browser sessions.
- **Delete Notes:** Each note comes with a delete button that allows users to remove notes they no longer need.

2. Click the "Add Note" button to save the note.
